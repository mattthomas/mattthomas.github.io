<h1>Matt Thomas</h1>

<p>I’m a teacher and writer currently living in Iowa City, IA. Primarily, I’m interested in the relationship between media, habits, identity, and culture in the United States. Sometimes I design, build, and maintain websites. Before all this, I used to do other stuff, including work in film production and private security. I’m originally from Seattle. I have a B.A. from the University of Southern California and a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa. Both in American Studies. <a href="https://ir.uiowa.edu/etd/5658/">My dissertation project</a> was a critical history of the life hacking movement.</p>
