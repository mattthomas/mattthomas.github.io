<h1>Matt Thomas</h1>

<p>I’m a teacher and writer living in Iowa City, IA. I was born and raised in Seattle. I have a B.A. from the University of Southern California and a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa. Both in American Studies. My dissertation project – the first of its kind anywhere – was a critical history of the life hacking movement.</p>
