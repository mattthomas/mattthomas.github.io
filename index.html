<h1>Matt Thomas</h1>

<p>I’m a teacher and writer working at the fuzzy intersection of English, rhetoric and composition, communication studies, media studies, science and technology studies, and U.S. history. Or, as I like to think of it, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_studies">American studies</a> meets <a href="http://media-ecology.org">media ecology</a>. Broadly speaking, I’m interested in what happens when print culture and other, older ways of knowing and being get ousted by screens, computers, and the like. In particular, I’m interested in the relationship between technology and work and the human condition. Before this, I used to do other stuff, including stints in film production, web design, and private security. I have a B.A. from the University of Southern California and a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa. Both in American studies. <a href="https://iro.uiowa.edu/esploro/outputs/doctoral/Life-hacking-a-critical-history-2004-2014/9983777155702771">My dissertation project</a> was a critical history of the early life hacking movement.</p>
